Clarity:(Not very good) 
The units of x and y axis are not mentioned. 
Title not proper, emission of what is being talked about is

Esthetic:(Not very good) 
The smaller size of dots should have been selected. 
Legend is missing.

Honesty
The source of data is missing. 

Suggestions.
You could have provided the D value of both(linear and polynomial) that would have help in understanding which is better estimator.
Providing unit is important.
