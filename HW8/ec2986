CLARITY:(Not Good) The title is missing and what function is applied on x1 and x2 is not mentioned whihc is making it very difficult to understand.

ESTHETIC:(Better) The colors are proper and the grid is used which is helping in understanding the value at all the points in the graph.
The font of axis should be bit bigger to make it more elegent. 

HONESTY:(Good) The need of showing data is bit ambigous. However as the mathematical calculation is done by python the data plot is accurate.
