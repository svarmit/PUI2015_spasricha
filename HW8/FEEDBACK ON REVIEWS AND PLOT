reviewed were harsh, but good! 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the 3d as usual makes comparison difficult. additionally 3d bind distort the perception: we should compare differences in height but we are left with the impression given byt he difference in volumes

the color is redundant with the year 

tick labels too small

the cause of dheath axis labels are offset with respect to the variable

typo in the title (parenthesis close that was never open)

============


not robust to color blindness: 10% of males cannot read your plot

axis labels too small

empty space at the left should be remove

point size unexplained and redundant with distance, enforcing an impression by doubly displaying


title ambiguous


ec2986
============

the 3d obstructs the structure, but the structure is symmetric so this is justified

the color is redundant with the z axis, but it helos read the y value in the 3D structure

the z axis label is ambiguous: spell the function out

the axis labels are too small to be readable




yf903
============

units missing in labels

tick labels too small

lines unexplained

color undistinguishable for the 10% of the male population that is color blind
